## MY EVER FAVORITE TEXT EDITOR(NEOVIM/VIM)
**File Structure:-**</br>
```~/.config/nvim/init.vim```</br>
```~/.config/nvim/autoload/plug.vim```</br>
```~/.config/nvim/plugged/*```</br>

>***init.vim*** is the file given in my repo.which will load when we open vim/nvim</br>
>using [***vim-plug***](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) for to maintain and install new plugins for my neovim</br>
>***~/.config/nvim/plugged/*** contains my extra added plugins files</br>
</br>
***If you don't want to use vim in terminal always use as an extension vim supports for most of the IDEs. I use VSCODE along with vim as an extension.</br>***
      
**For those who didn't userstand vim v/s neovim[nvim], neovim is the new version for vim which has more features by default than normal vim.**
